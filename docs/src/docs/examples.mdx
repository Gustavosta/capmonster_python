To run the examples in your local machine, please do the followings:

## Steps

1. Create a folder and clone the repository

    ```sh
    mkdir capmonster-python
    cd capmonster-python
    git init
    git clone https://github.com/alperensert/capmonster_python.git
    ```
2. Go to examples folder and install the requirements (examples only)

    ```sh
    cd examples
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Then set 2 environment variables for correctly run the examples, _API_KEY_ and _HEADLESS_
    1. Api key is your unique key to solve captchas
    2. Headless is needed for running selenium examples.

4. Now you are ready to run examples, e.g.

    ```sh
    python recaptchav2_selenium.py
    ```

> Note: If you want to run selenium examples, Firefox must be installed
