> First of all, you need an API key to work. You can get one from [here](https://capmonster.cloud)

Image to Text Captcha's can be send with two different ways.

### Send image with ImagePath

If you have the image on your local path, or if you can download it, use _image_path_ way.

```py title=image_to_text_with_image_path.py
from capmonster_python import ImageToTextTask

capmonster = ImageToTextTask("API_KEY")
task_id = capmonster.create_task(image_path="img.png")
result = capmonster.join_task_result(task_id)
print(result.get("text"))
```

### Send image as Base64 Encoded

If you have to handle the captchas real-time, 
you can download the image and convert it to Base64.

```python title=image_to_text_base64_encoded.py
from capmonster_python import ImageToTextTask

capmonster = ImageToTextTask("API_KEY")
task_id = capmonster.create_task(base64_encoded_image="base64encodedimage_as_string")
result = capmonster.join_task_result(task_id)
print(result.get("text"))
```

> Make sure to send it without line breaks while using Base64 Encoded way.
