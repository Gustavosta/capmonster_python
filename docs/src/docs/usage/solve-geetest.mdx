> First of all, you need an API key to work. You can get one from [here](https://capmonster.cloud)

## What you need
1. GeeTest identifier key (a.k.a. _gt_)
2. Challenge key
2. Website url

### How to get you needs?
- The gt, challenge and geetestApiServerSubdomain parameters are most often found inside the initGeetest JavaScript function.
- Also you can see in the HTML code of the page. 
You can find it in the **script** block, which appears after the page is fully loaded in the browser.

## Solve

```py title=solve_geetest.py
from capmonster_python import GeeTestTask

capmonster = GeeTestTask("API_KEY")
task_id = capmonster.create_task("website_url", "gt", "challenge")
result= capmonster.join_task_result(task_id)
print(result.get("challenge"))
print(result.get("seccode"))
print(result.get("validate"))
```

## Important Note
> Keep in mind, the _gt_ challenge is rarely updated. 
> But challenge value is always changing when everytime you see a GeeTest Captcha.
